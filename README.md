Inventory menu test

Stuff to be fixed - 
 - I never made the arrow actually work
 - Currently to stop ppl from taking items out with the num keys I have to clear the hotbar. As per usual, using a config can solve this as I can save the inventory data and then revert it back when the menu is closed.
